Find legal IPTV providers which may provide you with the link, username and password.

## Support type

App supports online lists including M3U, Xtream Codes and Stralker Portal which you can add in library's `create online list`.

Supporing local lists including m3u and txt file.

Supporting m3u pasted string.

## Media Hub

Starting at v1.0.34 for Windows & Xbox version. The app supports Emby, Jellyfin, WebDAV and DLNA as media servers.

Access it by clicking the top right botton in the `Library` Page.

The media info is accessible for Emby and Jellyfin servers. Currently there is no modification for poster wall yet. We'll see how it performs as media player now.

The project is aiming to be a multi-media hub as Infuse and Kodi did in iOS and Android.

On console the app is using server transcoding for 4K HEVC videos due to codec issue. Other videos are using native hardware decode.

## Terms of Service

IPTV Fluent does not host or distribute any content or re-direct you to any reseller. Please find m3u8 or m3u link provided by other legal IPTV providers.

If you encounter any bug in the app, feel free to contact me.
